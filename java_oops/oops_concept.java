programming languages can be classified into 3 primary types

Unstructured Programming Languages: 
The most primitive of all programming languages having sequentially flow of control. Code is repeated through out the program
Structured Programming Languages:
 Has non-sequentially flow of control. Use of functions allows for re-use of code.
Object Oriented Programming Languages:
 Combines Data & Action Together.
 

OOPs Concepts in Java:
 What is OOPS?
*Object -Oriented Programing System(OOPs) is a programing concept that works on the principal of abstraction,polymerphism,inheritance,and encapsulation.

*it allows  users to create objects they want and create methods to handle thoes objects.



OOPs Concepts in Java with Examples
1)Class :
The class is the one of theBasic concept of OOPs 
which is a group of similar entities.
It is only a logical component not the physical entity.


example:
If you had a class called " Expensive Cars" it could have Objects like  BMW,jaguar,Mercedes,TOYOTAetc.
 
Its properties can be Price or Speed of these cars.
While the methods may be performed with these cars are driving ,braking,reverse etc.


2)Object:
An object can be defined as an instance of this class,and there can be multiple instances of the class in a program.

An Object is one of the java OOPS concepts which contain both the data and the function ,which operates on the data.


example:
chair,bike,table,car ,etc.


3)Inheritance:
Inheritance is one of the Basic Concepts of OOPs in
which one object acquires the properties and behaviors of the parent object.

Its creating a parent--child relationship between two classes.

4)Polymerphism:
Polymorphism means "many forms".

Polymorphism refers to one of the OOPS concept in java which is the ability of 
a variable,object or function to take on multiple forms.


Example:
In english ,the verb "run "
has  different meaning if you use with a laptop,a foot race and a business.

Here ,we understand the meening of "run" based on the other words used along with it.

It same also applied to Polymorphism.

5)Abstraction:
Abstraction is one of the OOp concept in java which is an act of representing essential features 
without including background details.

it is a technique of creating a new data type that is suited for a specific application. 


example:
While driving a car you don not have to be concerned with its internal working.
here you just need to be concerned with the parts like gears,steering wheel,accelerator,etc.

6)Encapsulation:
Encapsulation is one of the best OOps Concept of Wrapping the data and code.
In this OOps Concept the variables of a class are always hidden from other classes.

it can be accessed using the methods of their current class.

example:
in school ,
a student cannot exist without a class.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7)Association:
Association is a relationship between two objects.
It is one of the OOP Concepts in Java which defines the diversity between objects.
In this OOP concept, all objects have their separate lifecycle, and there is no owner.


example:
many students can associate with one teacher while one student can also associate with multiple teachers.


8)Aggregation:
In this technique, all objects have their separate lifecycle.
 However, there is ownership such that child object can’t belong to another parent object.
  For example consider class/objects department and teacher. Here, a single teacher can’t belong to multiple departments, 
  but even if we delete the department, the teacher object will never be destroyed.


  9) Composition
Composition is a specialized form of Aggregation. It is also called “death” relationship. 
Child objects do not have their lifecycle so when parent object deletes all child object will also delete automatically. 
For that, let’s take an example of House and rooms. Any house can have several rooms. One room can’t become part of two different houses.
 So, if you delete the house  -  room will also be deleted.


Advantages of OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming System):
*Reuse of code through inheritance
*Flexibility through polymorphism
*Effective problem solving
*Modularity for easier troubleshooting.and easy to understand.
